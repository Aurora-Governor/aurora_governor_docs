# AI Governance Runtime
### Defensible AI for Regulated Deployment

---

## The Problem
Modern AI systems **cannot produce admissible evidence** for their decisions.

This creates:
- Regulatory exposure
- Legal and audit failure
- Blocked deployment in high-value sectors

If an AI decision is challenged, most organizations **cannot reconstruct or justify it**.

---

## The Solution
**AI Governance Runtime** is infrastructure that makes AI decisions:

- **Auditable** — deterministic, machine-verifiable traces
- **Defensible** — justified answers, refusals, and escalations
- **Regulator-ready** — evidence by design, not post-hoc

Governance runs *inside* the system, not as an afterthought.

---

## What It Enables
- Safe AI deployment in healthcare, finance, government, and defense
- Faster regulatory approval
- Reduced legal and compliance risk
- Clear separation of model behavior and organizational liability

Governance becomes a **license to operate**.

---

## Why It Matters Now
As AI capability scales, **liability scales faster than fluency**.

Without enforceable refusal and auditability:
> Responsibility increases while evidence disappears.

AI Governance Runtime restores evidentiary control.

---

## Positioning
- Not a model
- Not an ethics layer
- Not a policy framework

**Core infrastructure for legally survivable AI deployment**.
